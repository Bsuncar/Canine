				<h2> What makes the BuddyBed so special? </h2>
				<p> Great question! We believe we’ve reached a new height in dog bed manufacturing, creating the perfect combination of durable, affordable and comfortable materials. Its rugged outer layer is removable and easily washable - making cleaning dirt, hair and liquids quick and easy! </p>
				<p> Also, our styrofoam filling beads are guaranteed to conform to your dog’s body - keeping your puppy comfortable all the way through the night! </p>
				<hr>
				<h2> Is the BuddyBed machine washable? </h2>
				<p> The outer polyester canvas cover is machine washable. Set your dryer to tumble dry/no heat - or you can air dry your canvas cover! </p>
				<hr>
				<h2> What is the BuddyBed made from? </h2>
				<p> The BuddyBed is made from a combination of synthetic and PVC polyester material. Not only does it guarantee your dog stays warm, the BuddyBed is weather-resistant. In fact, the styrofoam filling is held in its own removable water-resistant inner bag - protecting it from claws, tears and liquids! </p>
				<hr>
				<h2> Are those materials eco-friendly? </h2>
				<p> Yes! The filling is made from recycled styrofoam beads, and the 1680D PVC-backed polyester canvas has been deemed eco-friendly by REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of chemicals), the “EU regulation governing the placement on the market of chemical substances.” </p>
